Hereâ€™s a rough roadmap of things to do.

This repo will dogfood on itself, so eventually it will create a navigable
documentation widget that can be embedded in an arbitrary web page.

- integrate it to zerotoherojs.com dashboard
- Create a script to convert the project folder structure to JSON.
- Create a generator to convert that JSON into a HTML file tree.
- Create a minimal theme css (goal is to let the widget adapt to the overall
  look and feel of the web page that itâ€™s going to be embedded in.
- More to come later.
- Babelify cw.js (do an ES6 -> cw.js transformer to make it run in a wider range of user agents)
- better handling of "open link in new window" on the main preview area.
